Documentation
=============
To build the doc automatically from the source code and post it to the server, you typically will do the following:

    $ cd doc/
    $ make clean html
    $ rsync -av _build/html/ username@server:/srv/track

=======
Tagging
=======
Once a new version has been packaged and uploaded, it is a good habit to tag the corresponding commit in the master branch of the git tracking system with the version number. This is done with a command similar to the following:

    git tag 1.5.0 5de1c07841e82b62cdd908e1910119fa9e22933c

To build and upload the gMiner pacakge to the python package index you just need to change directory to the place where the setup.py script is found and run the following command:

    python setup.py sdist upload

The version number needs to be incremented every time in the following files:

/setup.py
/track/__init__.py
/README.md

=============

To run the special automated parsing tests, you can simply enter ipython and type the three following commands:
